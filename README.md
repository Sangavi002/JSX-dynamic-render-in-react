Dynamic Rendering uses JavaScript variables within JSX, enabling dynamic content updates (e.g., <p>{text}</p>). Conditional Rendering applies JavaScript logic to decide what to display based on conditions (e.g., {isDay ? <p>Day</p> : <p>Night</p>}). Both enhance React components' flexibility and interactivity.
